> As of May 2024 the Backstage documentation for [Permissions](https://backstage.io/docs/permissions/getting-started) has not been updated for the new backend system. We've referred to the [Migration Guide](https://backstage.io/docs/backend-system/building-backends/migrating/#the-permission-plugin) to set up the Permission plugin for the new backend system.
